# HomeBridge-Mini
This is the documentation repository for my homebridge project on a mid-2010 Mac Mini

Like a lot of people, the choice of device for a new project like this can start with "what you have laying around".  In my case, it was a mid-2010 mac mini.

2.4Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo
8GB RAM
500GB SSD

The first problem I ran in to was that Ubuntu version 20.04 would crash on the install, so I tried version 19, still a no go.  I had a bootable [Ununtu version 16](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/), and it isntalled without issue.

This repository is going to document all the steps that [Wiki](https://github.com/Josh-Duncan/HomeBridge-Mini/wiki/), as well as configurations and limitations.
